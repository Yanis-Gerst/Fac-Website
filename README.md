# General

The purpose of this website is that students can share their own revisions sheets and notes as well as viewing other major's content.

I built this website to learn back-end with NextJs and mongoDb. There are 4 branches available:
	1. React only 
	2. React + NextJs
	3. React + NextJs + MongoDb

This website only need a database to correctly render and the front-end is dynamic which enables this website to be very versatible and scalable.
